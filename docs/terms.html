      <p>BlockBird is a Chrome browser extension that helps users manage public wallet addresses, scan webpage content, and access a curated directory of blockchain explorers. We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your data.</p>
      
      <h3>What We Collect</h3>
      <p>BlockBird does not collect or store any personal data, private keys, or wallet credentials.</p>
      
      <p>The extension may store public wallet addresses locally in your browser for convenience. These are not transmitted to any external server.</p>
      
      <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
      <p>All data processing is done locally within your browser. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Wallet Manager stores public addresses in local storage.</li>
        <li>The Content Scanner reads webpage content only on active user interaction and does not transmit any data.</li>
        <li>The Explorer Directory is static and does not track usage.</li>
        <li>We do not track, log, or transmit your browsing activity or wallet interactions.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>BlockBird does not integrate with any third-party analytics, ad networks, or cloud services. All operations are self-contained.</p>
      
      <h3>Your Control</h3>
      <p>You can remove stored addresses or uninstall the extension at any time. Since no data is sent to us, no additional steps are needed to delete your information.</p>
