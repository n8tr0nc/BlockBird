      <p>BlockBird is a Chrome browser extension that helps users manage public wallet addresses, scan webpage content, and access a curated directory of blockchain explorers. We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your data.</p>
      
      <h3>What We Collect</h3>
      <p>BlockBird does not collect or store any personal data, private keys, or wallet credentials.</p>
      
      <p>The extension may store public wallet addresses locally in your browser for convenience. These are not transmitted to any external server.</p>
      
      <h3>How We Use Data</h3>
      <p>All data processing is done locally within your browser. Specifically:</p>
      
      The Wallet Manager stores public addresses in local storage.
      The Content Scanner reads webpage content only on active user interaction and does not transmit any data.
      The Explorer Directory is static and does not track usage.
      We do not track, log, or transmit your browsing activity or wallet interactions.
      
      Third-Party Services
      BlockBird does not integrate with any third-party analytics, ad networks, or cloud services. All operations are self-contained.
      
      Your Control
      You can remove stored addresses or uninstall the extension at any time. Since no data is sent to us, no additional steps are needed to delete your information.
