        <h3>Site Scanner</h3>
        <p>BlockBird’s Webpage Scanner helps you uncover hidden opportunities by scanning the current webpage for key terms like 'airdrop,' 'points,' and 'rewards.' With just one click, the scanner analyzes on-page content and highlights where these keywords appear, saving you the time and effort of manual searching. This tool is especially useful for discovering token distributions, engagement campaigns, or loyalty systems that may not be immediately visible. It provides a simple report showing how often each term is mentioned, and clearly marks them within the page for quick reference. Whether you're airdrop hunting or researching new platforms, the Scanner equips you with instant insights to help you stay ahead.</p>
